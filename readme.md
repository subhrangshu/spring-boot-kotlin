# Spring-Boot Kotlin Demo Project on Top of Gradle and Configured with MySQL database.

This is a demo Spring Boot application with gradle as package manager and MySQL as database.

Several routing techniques have been implemented and you can choose the one that you like.

For this, you must have latest `Gradle` installed with Java8 preferred instead of Java11 however both works. You also need to install `Kotlin` in order to run.

The file `/src/main/kotlin/resources/application.properties` contains Database details, modify it to suit your project environment.

To run in linux, open two terminal and type both commands in two different terminals so one would continuously build the newer changes and other would run the changes.
```
./gradlew build --continuous
./gradlew bootRun
``` 
This would trigger a live reloading session.
